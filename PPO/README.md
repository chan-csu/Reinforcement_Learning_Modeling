# SPM-DFBA

SPM-DFBA is an algoritm for inferring microbial interactions by modeling microbial metabolism in a community as a decision making process, a markov decision process more specifically, where individual agents learn strategies that lead to their long-term survival by trying different strategies and improve their strategies according to proximal policy optimization algorithm.

The scripts are written in a way to make reproducing the results and simulating new cases as easy as possible, similar to OpenAI gym framework. 

Toolkit.py includes all classes and functions that are required for defining new agents and environment. After successfully defining the environment, performing DFBA is straightforward. 

For SPM-DFBA paper, we tested multiple scenarios. All of these scenarios can be executed by using the case_studies.ipynb jupyter notebook. 

Also, all the figures for the paper is generated by using data_analysis.ipynb notebook. 

Each of these notebooks provide valuable information on generating/analyzing the results.
